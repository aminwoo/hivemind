  <h3>HiveMind</h3>

  A free UCI Bughouse engine.

</div>

## Overview
Crazyhouse is a chess variant in which captured enemy pieces can be reintroduced, or dropped, into the game as one's own. It was derived as a two-player, single-board variant of bughouse chess.

## Installation

`Hivemind` uses JAX, which can be installed with 
```
pip install -U "jax[cuda12_pip]" -f https://storage.googleapis.com/jax-releases/jax_cuda_releases.html
```
```
pip install tensorflow[and-cuda]
```
The rest of the dependencies are handled by `poetry` and is as simple as - 
```
pip install poetry
poetry install 
```
to install. 

```
pip install git+https://github.com/aminwoo/pgx.git
pip install git+https://github.com/lowrollr/mctx-az.git
```

# Evaluation


## Training
Weights for a network trained on 600k human games and further trained via self-play is provided. A trainer interface is provided to train your own model from scratch of continue training existing checkpoints. The module expects a policy target which sums to 1 and a value target (-1, 0 or 1). In the case of supervised learning, this will be a one-hot encoding of the expected action. Otherwise, it will be the policy action weights generated from the alphazero algorithm.
